**A novel interdisciplinary research project exploring the intersection of AI, philosophy, and cultural studies.**

üìú Elevator Pitch
We're training AI models on diverse philosophical traditions (Western, Eastern, and digital) and visualizing their learning processes to uncover hidden cultural biases embedded in AI systems. Think of it as computational archaeology for the future of thought‚Äîusing code instead of shovels to excavate the foundational assumptions shaping artificial minds.
üîç Project Overview
Cultural Neural Hermeneutics (CNH) is an interdisciplinary research initiative exploring how cultural and philosophical assumptions shape AI development and behavior. Our approach:

Train specialized AI models on distinct philosophical corpora from Western philosophy (e.g., Plato), Eastern philosophy (e.g., Laozi), and modern digital discourse.
Capture developmental trajectories through detailed snapshots of internal model states during training, including weights, activations, gradients, and outputs.
Apply advanced topological data analysis and dimensionality reduction techniques (UMAP, t-SNE) to visualize the evolution of each model's "conceptual space" over time.
Develop an interactive visualization platform allowing users to explore model developmental timelines, perturb internal representations, and observe semantic shifts.
Design AI architectures embodying different philosophical epistemologies (Future phase) comparing models inspired by Platonic, Pragmatist, Buddhist, and Cartesian frameworks.
Create self-reflective AI systems (Future phase) capable of analyzing and describing their own conceptual organization.

üåü Why This Matters

AI Ethics & Bias Mitigation: Reveal cultural biases embedded within AI models to develop fairer, more equitable systems
Interpretability & Transparency: Create new methods for understanding AI reasoning processes, enhancing trust and accountability
Cross-Cultural Understanding: Gain insights into diverse philosophical perspectives through computational modeling
Novel AI Design Paradigms: Explore building AI systems inspired by non-Western philosophical traditions
Computational Humanities: Contribute empirical data to fields traditionally outside computational analysis

## Quickstart

1. **Process Data**
   ```bash
   python -m src.data_processing your_text.txt
   ```
   This cleans the text, splits it into training and validation sets, and writes `train.jsonl` and `val.jsonl`.

2. **Train Model**
   ```bash
   python -m src.train_distilbert train.jsonl val.jsonl --epochs 3
   ```
   Activations and training metrics are saved under `model_output/`.
